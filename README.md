# LeetCode Problems Repository

Welcome to my LeetCode Problems repository! This project is a personal collection of coding challenges from [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/), along with my solutions, thought processes, and learnings along the way.

## 📚 Purpose
This repository serves as a learning journal and a resource for anyone interested in algorithmic problem solving. Here, I document:
- My solutions to various LeetCode problems
- The reasoning and strategies I used
- Insights, mistakes, and improvements I discovered

## 🛤️ My Journey
Solving LeetCode problems has been both challenging and rewarding. Each problem pushes me to think critically, learn new algorithms, and improve my coding skills. I believe that sharing not just the solutions, but also the thought process behind them, can help others (and my future self!) understand the nuances of problem solving.

## 🗂️ Repository Structure
Problems are organized by topic (e.g., string, hashmap, sorting, binary-tree) and each file contains:
- The problem statement (as a comment)
- My solution in TypeScript
- Comments explaining my approach

## 📝 Example
Here's a sample of how problems are documented:

```typescript
// 5. Longest Palindromic Substring
// Given a string s, return the longest palindromic substring in s.
// ...
function longestPalindrome(s: string): string {
    // ...solution and explanation...
}
```

## 💡 What You'll Find
- Clean, well-commented TypeScript solutions
- Honest notes about what I found tricky or interesting
- Occasional alternative approaches or optimizations

## 🤝 Contributing
This is a personal learning project, but feel free to fork, star, or open issues if you have suggestions or want to discuss solutions!

## 📬 Feedback
If you find this repository helpful or have ideas for improvement, I'd love to hear from you. Let's learn and grow together!
